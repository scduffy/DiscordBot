02/16/2018 *@* 09:14:17(EST): I don't know what exactly will lead to a satesfying life, and I'm not about to work really hard for things I don't want. If I'd gone in wanting to be an officer, I would still be there, but I don't think that's what I want, and I'm focusing on other things. End of story. Anything going on today Aiden?  Any exams?
02/08/2018 *@* 20:33:52(EST): eh, the tiny sample of shawn and his crowd in high school did it, and my THOT sister said she tried it in college and all the nerd boys were stinky and didn't care about grades. I don't want to take up a hobby where the people are all assholes who don't take care of themselves and think they're better than others, but that does not describe the tabletop community.
02/17/2018 *@* 13:43:16(EST):http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/paying-the-price-for-breakdown-of-the-countrys-bourgeois-culture-20170809.html?mobi=trueWhat are your thoughts? I think I agree with the importance of pushing the values stated: "Get married before you have children and strive to stay married for their sake. Get the education you need for gainful employment, work hard, and avoid idleness. Go the extra mile for your employer or client. Be a patriot, ready to serve the country. Be neighborly, civic-minded, and charitable. Avoid coarse language in public. Be respectful of authority. Eschew substance abuse and crime."Though of course some old values are no longer useful such as keeping to whites only and eschuing sex

02/08/2018 *@* 20:38:22(EST): I actually came in doing NROTC wanting to do that, but discovered I hate running and doing pushups till the point of failure, so I don't think that's the path for me
02/08/2018 *@* 20:04:14(EST): I've given up on wining over any girls in person with my non existent personality, and switched exclusively to tinder. I still have yet to create a profile, not being sure what pics to use. I don't want to just slap something on there but I have no idea what would be a flattering and well thought out shot. I will however include the picture of me making frens with a horse after that in my profile.
02/08/2018 *@* 19:58:12(EST): fuck you my boys fuck you up don't disrespec me
02/08/2018 *@* 16:56:54(EST): I hope he has really hit his stride and is surrounded by friends and good grades and has a gf. And we'll go to our reunion and I'll fly his private helicopter onto the grass and he'll step down holding his beutiful wife's hand,and we'll all go wow mark good job
02/07/2018 *@* 17:58:31(EST): "According to some studies, 18-year-old males have a refractory period of about 15 minutes, while those in their 70s take about 20 hours, with the average for all men being about half an hour.[15] Although rarer, some males exhibit no refractory period or a refractory period lasting less than 10 seconds" huh feminine penis is actually master race

02/22/2018 *@* 10:16:53(EST):So what's the difference between knowing things like a rainy day or having your foot stepped on make you upset, and knowing if not being able to be seen as right makes you upset?  You would agree the former is possible?
02/23/2018 *@* 13:41:04(EST):Honestly,  I don't know if I'll ever be truly happy and fulfilled from a job, but for most of us, that's not what careers are. In the end, you look for something you like, but live for your friends, family, hobbies, and to some degree your work.
02/24/2018 *@* 13:20:08(EST):"There is a general consensus that the EASA theoretical knowledge exams are actually too in-depth, requiring students to learn huge volumes of complex and irrelevant material, much of which is not retained after the exams have been passed."

Eventually this chat ceased as the crew was cleared for takeoff. The takeoff was normal until the main wheels left the ground, at which point the aircraft commenced a violent rolling motion and the right wing dropped."Theeighties. Jpg
02/25/2018 *@* 13:47:32(EST):Laurance, please do not subvert yourself for others pointless causes. A man deserves to live his life, making his own choices, embracing his brothers truly, and loving his family wholeheartedly. This false cause of 'cucks' and 'feminism' is only an effort to steal this from you, to make you fight your brothers and those you love, for the enrichment of the bastards who care not for you or your dreams. Please do not let such things limit you. Do not avoid living your life the best you can out of fear of 'nu-males' and 'degeneracy'. Do not fear to express and live your love because of how those still asleep will view you. The hypothetical men in your pictures are just the same as you. They had dreams, they had wives they loved, but they threw these away because they had been manipulated into seeing no other choice, because they feared, and thus could not think to fight for what is theirs. Just as you fear to share your talent for cooking with the girl you care about, and fear to feel, that you be seen as weak and unmanly. Trust me, none of what others say matters. I've lived for 18 years trying to be something for others, afraid to even have a hobby. This is where such ideologies lead, to being a man who looks back and realizes the happiness  he could have had, and the dreams he's allowed to languish. I know it's hard to wake up to these things, but you'll be a man soon, and hard as it is, finding your desires and pursuing them is what makes a man.
02/26/2018 *@* 09:27:42(EST):So, if chickens and cows became friendlier, would you not eat them? Is it ok to eat vicious street dogs? I can kinda see where you're coming from though, as while I don't see eating dogs as wrong, it does breed ingratitude and a failure to care for those who care for you.
02/26/2018 *@* 10:00:34(EST):Service animals are perfectly acceptable to eat ethically, but should still be taboo socially, as their consumption encourages anti social behavior, and a failure to appreciate or help out fellow citizens
02/26/2018 *@* 10:08:23(EST):Many chicken slaughterhouse workers do get fucked up mentally. There us corilational evedence, though not experimental that chicken slaughterhouse workers have higher rates of antisocial mental states. Butchering dogs would fuck the workers up way more, and would harm the consumer for the reasons stated above
