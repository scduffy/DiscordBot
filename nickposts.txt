02/16/2018 @ 09:14:17(EST): I don't know what exactly will lead to a satesfying life, and I'm not about to work really hard for things I don't want. If I'd gone in wanting to be an officer, I would still be there, but I don't think that's what I want, and I'm focusing on other things. End of story. Anything going on today Aiden?  Any exams?
02/08/2018 @ 20:33:52(EST): eh, the tiny sample of shawn and his crowd in high school did it, and my THOT sister said she tried it in college and all the nerd boys were stinky and didn't care about grades. I don't want to take up a hobby where the people are all assholes who don't take care of themselves and think they're better than others, but that does not describe the tabletop community.

I think I agree with the importance of pushing the values stated: "Get married before you have children and strive to stay married for their sake. Get the education you need for gainful employment, work hard, and avoid idleness. Go the extra mile for your employer or client. Be a patriot, ready to serve the country. Be neighborly, civic-minded, and charitable. Avoid coarse language in public. Be respectful of authority. Eschew substance abuse and crime."Though of course some old values are no longer useful such as keeping to whites only and eschuing sex

02/08/2018 @ 20:38:22(EST): I actually came in doing NROTC wanting to do that, but discovered I hate running and doing pushups till the point of failure, so I don't think that's the path for me
02/08/2018 @ 20:04:14(EST): I've given up on wining over any girls in person with my non existent personality, and switched exclusively to tinder. I still have yet to create a profile, not being sure what pics to use. I don't want to just slap something on there but I have no idea what would be a flattering and well thought out shot. I will however include the picture of me making frens with a horse after that in my profile.
02/08/2018 @ 19:58:12(EST): fuck you my boys fuck you up don't disrespec me
02/08/2018 @ 16:56:54(EST): I hope he has really hit his stride and is surrounded by friends and good grades and has a gf. And we'll go to our reunion and I'll fly his private helicopter onto the grass and he'll step down holding his beutiful wife's hand,and we'll all go wow mark good job
02/07/2018 @ 17:58:31(EST): "According to some studies, 18-year-old males have a refractory period of about 15 minutes, while those in their 70s take about 20 hours, with the average for all men being about half an hour.[15] Although rarer, some males exhibit no refractory period or a refractory period lasting less than 10 seconds" huh feminine penis is actually master race
