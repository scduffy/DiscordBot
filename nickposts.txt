02/16/2018  09:14:17(EST): I don't know what exactly will lead to a satesfying life, and I'm not about to work really hard for things I don't want. If I'd gone in wanting to be an officer, I would still be there, but I don't think that's what I want, and I'm focusing on other things. End of story. Anything going on today Aiden?  Any exams?
02/08/2018  20:33:52(EST): eh, the tiny sample of shawn and his crowd in high school did it, and my THOT sister said she tried it in college and all the nerd boys were stinky and didn't care about grades. I don't want to take up a hobby where the people are all assholes who don't take care of themselves and think they're better than others, but that does not describe the tabletop community.
02/17/2018  13:43:16(EST):http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/paying-the-price-for-breakdown-of-the-countrys-bourgeois-culture-20170809.html?mobi=trueWhat are your thoughts? I think I agree with the importance of pushing the values stated: "Get married before you have children and strive to stay married for their sake. Get the education you need for gainful employment, work hard, and avoid idleness. Go the extra mile for your employer or client. Be a patriot, ready to serve the country. Be neighborly, civic-minded, and charitable. Avoid coarse language in public. Be respectful of authority. Eschew substance abuse and crime."Though of course some old values are no longer useful such as keeping to whites only and eschuing sex

02/08/2018  20:38:22(EST): I actually came in doing NROTC wanting to do that, but discovered I hate running and doing pushups till the point of failure, so I don't think that's the path for me
02/08/2018  20:04:14(EST): I've given up on wining over any girls in person with my non existent personality, and switched exclusively to tinder. I still have yet to create a profile, not being sure what pics to use. I don't want to just slap something on there but I have no idea what would be a flattering and well thought out shot. I will however include the picture of me making frens with a horse after that in my profile.
02/08/2018  19:58:12(EST): fuck you my boys fuck you up don't disrespec me
02/08/2018  16:56:54(EST): I hope he has really hit his stride and is surrounded by friends and good grades and has a gf. And we'll go to our reunion and I'll fly his private helicopter onto the grass and he'll step down holding his beutiful wife's hand,and we'll all go wow mark good job

02/22/2018  10:16:53(EST):So what's the difference between knowing things like a rainy day or having your foot stepped on make you upset, and knowing if not being able to be seen as right makes you upset?  You would agree the former is possible?
02/23/2018  13:41:04(EST):Honestly,  I don't know if I'll ever be truly happy and fulfilled from a job, but for most of us, that's not what careers are. In the end, you look for something you like, but live for your friends, family, hobbies, and to some degree your work.
02/24/2018  13:20:08(EST):"There is a general consensus that the EASA theoretical knowledge exams are actually too in-depth, requiring students to learn huge volumes of complex and irrelevant material, much of which is not retained after the exams have been passed."

Eventually this chat ceased as the crew was cleared for takeoff. The takeoff was normal until the main wheels left the ground, at which point the aircraft commenced a violent rolling motion and the right wing dropped."Theeighties. Jpg
02/25/2018  13:47:32(EST):Laurance, please do not subvert yourself for others pointless causes. A man deserves to live his life, making his own choices, embracing his brothers truly, and loving his family wholeheartedly. This false cause of 'cucks' and 'feminism' is only an effort to steal this from you, to make you fight your brothers and those you love, for the enrichment of the bastards who care not for you or your dreams. Please do not let such things limit you. Do not avoid living your life the best you can out of fear of 'nu-males' and 'degeneracy'. Do not fear to express and live your love because of how those still asleep will view you. The hypothetical men in your pictures are just the same as you. They had dreams, they had wives they loved, but they threw these away because they had been manipulated into seeing no other choice, because they feared, and thus could not think to fight for what is theirs. Just as you fear to share your talent for cooking with the girl you care about, and fear to feel, that you be seen as weak and unmanly. Trust me, none of what others say matters. I've lived for 18 years trying to be something for others, afraid to even have a hobby. This is where such ideologies lead, to being a man who looks back and realizes the happiness  he could have had, and the dreams he's allowed to languish. I know it's hard to wake up to these things, but you'll be a man soon, and hard as it is, finding your desires and pursuing them is what makes a man.
02/26/2018  09:27:42(EST):So, if chickens and cows became friendlier, would you not eat them? Is it ok to eat vicious street dogs? I can kinda see where you're coming from though, as while I don't see eating dogs as wrong, it does breed ingratitude and a failure to care for those who care for you.
02/26/2018  10:00:34(EST):Service animals are perfectly acceptable to eat ethically, but should still be taboo socially, as their consumption encourages anti social behavior, and a failure to appreciate or help out fellow citizens
02/26/2018  10:08:23(EST):Many chicken slaughterhouse workers do get fucked up mentally. There us corilational evedence, though not experimental that chicken slaughterhouse workers have higher rates of antisocial mental states. Butchering dogs would fuck the workers up way more, and would harm the consumer for the reasons stated above

The Queen, though, insisted that her son be allowed to remain with his ship.[13] Prince Andrew remained on board Invincible to serve as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot, flying on missions that included anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare, Exocet missile decoy, casualty evacuation, transport, and search and air rescue.[14][15][16] He witnessed the Argentinian attack on the SS Atlantic Conveyor.[17]At the cessation of the war, Invincible returned to Portsmouth, where the Queen and Prince Philip joined other families of the crew in welcoming the vessel home.

In establishing his rule, the king was aided by the efforts of the US government, who used the monarchy as a bulwark against communist gains in Southeast Asia.[15]:50King Bhumibol was the world's longest reigning monarch at the time of his death in October 2016.

05/24/2018  17:59:48(EST):I'm happy for you both. Particularly grant since you said you're really looking for pay. Personally though, I don't think I'm motivated to serve my country and make   considerable sacrifices for like 20 percent more cash. You should do that because you are fully willing to go and make yourself into the best officer you can be and make a difference.
06/02/2018  23:37:43(EST):It would be nice, but I do plan to fill up my time with working out, classes, flying, guitar, and e6B. I've been slacking so far, but I'm getting my shit together, soloing, and starting on the schedule I've mapped out. A job, particularly a cool one like learning to make coffee, would be a better route to a successful summer, as you just need to show up prepared and work hard on shift, not be just sitting around trying not to waste time, but I'm not going to make a commitment and be a shitty employee or have to duck out later in the summer
06/03/2018  00:08:06(EST):Well, we both know I've had this flaw in the past, and I assume you're trying to help me and I appriciate it, but I feel pissed to think about it. Moving to a better school or better major is not wrong. Giving up on something you care about and said you'd finish because of adversity is. I am not upset about some of your examples, which are just making good choices, but I have given up on other things I am not proud of. I'm going to do what I set out to do this week, and that's all I can do.
06/03/2018  00:18:55(EST):I know it's just one thing but it's something you expect from me, so I'll do it, and I've already committed so I gotta, besides, we are the sum of our actions, I need to find things to work hard on and commit to every day
06/03/2018  00:22:18(EST):I'm really tempted by AFROTC. I want to give back to our country and do all that cool stuff, but I don't know if I could hack it, or if I'm a good enough person. My thinking has been if I can keep lifting this summer than I may have a chance.
06/09/2018  20:11:56(EST):Absolutely disgusting how successful this woman has been in our country after making adds for our enemies and selling out our captured service members to torture just because she felt she was so special and smart
06/13/2018  18:53:27(EST):In one entry Einstein wrote that the “Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.”
06/15/2018  12:04:37(EST):But then Tyler only says the water will make it worse. Chemistry tells us it would have helped. Was this a plot device,or annother message to follow through with what you know you need to do instead of being self destructive such as allowing the burn to worsen
